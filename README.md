# Local Weather Tracker  

This is my final project written about an application to track local weather.  
The program uses the **Open-Meteo API** to fetch live weather data.  

In this application, users can:  
- Add a new weather observation (city, country, temperature, wind speed, and time).  
- List all stored observations.  
- Update the notes field of a specific observation.  
- Delete an observation when it is no longer needed.  

## How to Run  
```bash.
pip install -r requirements.txt
python finalproject_CSIS_LamVo.py
